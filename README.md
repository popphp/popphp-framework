INSTALL
-------
There are multiple ways you can get Pop PHP Framework into your project.

You can create a new project, which is recommended. This way, you will have
access to the CLI-helper script `pop-kettle` in the main project folder:

```console
$ composer create-project -s beta popphp/popphp-framework project-folder
```

Alternatively, you can add it to an existing project with this command:

```console
$ composer require popphp/popphp-framework
```

Or, you can add it your project's `composer.json` file:

    "require": {
        "popphp/popphp-framework": "^4.5.0-beta-4"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "beta"

Also, you can clone this repository and install it directly:

```console
$ composer install
```

### Kettle CLI-Helper

If choose to install the framework in a way that the `pop-kettle` CLI-helper
script is not available in the main project folder, you can place a copy of
the script from the `vendor/popphp/pop-kettle/kettle` location:

```bash
$ cp vendor/popphp/popphp-framework/kettle .
```

And make sure the newly copied `kettle` script is set to execute (755)

```bash
$ chmod 755 kettle
```
