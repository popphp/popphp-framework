INSTALL
-------
There are multiple ways you can get Pop PHP Framework into your project.

You can create a new project, which is recommended. This way, you will have
access to the CLI-helper script `pop-kettle` in the main project folder:

```console
$ composer create-project popphp/popphp-framework project-folder
```

Alternatively, you can add it to an existing project with this command:

```console
$ composer require popphp/popphp-framework
```

Or, you can add it your project's `composer.json` file:

    "require": {
        "popphp/popphp-framework": "^5.0.0"
    }

Also, you can clone this repository and install it directly:

```console
$ composer install
```

### Kettle CLI-Helper

If choose to install the framework in a way that the `pop-kettle` CLI-helper
script is not available in the main project folder, you can place a copy of
the script from the `vendor/popphp/pop-kettle/kettle` location:

```bash
$ cp vendor/popphp/popphp-framework/kettle .
```
Once you've copied the script over, you have to change the reference to the script's
config file from:

```php
    $app = new Pop\Application($autoloader, include __DIR__ . '/config/app.console.php');
```

to

```php
    $app = new Pop\Application($autoloader, include __DIR__ . '/vendor/popphp/pop-kettle/config/app.console.php');
```

and make sure the newly copied `kettle` script is set to execute (755)

```bash
$ chmod 755 kettle
```
